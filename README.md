# File Transformer

Data manipulation is a fundamental aspect of many jobs which is why I have had a number of people ask me to help them with it over the years. I usually write a python script to execute on the csv or xlsx file and give them back the result but what if they could do it themselves? This is where I explored using natural language to manipulate csv files.

Here is a video of the deployed app. You can see we start with a dirty csv file where some of the PO numbers contain a PO- prefix and some do not. I then upload the csv file, describe that I would like a PO- prefix added to these values if there isnâ€™t one already there and then it returns the transformed file.
